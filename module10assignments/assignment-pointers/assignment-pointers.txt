Q1.Write a program to find the product of two numbers using pointers.
Ans-
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b, product;
    int *p1, *p2;
    cin >> a >> b;
    p1 = &a;
    p2 = &b;
    product = (*p1) * (*p2);
    cout << product;
    return 0;
}

Q2.int *p, q;
Ans- Syntax is correct: p is a pointer and q is an integer.

Q3.Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
b = *ptr + 1;
ptr = &b;
cout << *ptr << " " << a << " " << b;
Ans-11 10 11

Q4.Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 15, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
int *ptr2 = &b;
*ptr = *ptr2;
Ans- a gets value of b

Q5.Is the following program snippet correct?
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;
Ans- No, the pointer is not initialized before dereferencing.
